<h1>Javascript30- Day 3</h1>
<h3>The challenge was to make updates to CSS by using Javascript. Along with the starter code, I added more features for user-friendliness:</h3>


Added Box-Shadow Controls: Four new range inputs were added to control the box-shadow properties - horizontal shadow, vertical shadow, blur radius, and spread radius.

Updated CSS: CSS was updated to apply the box-shadow property directly to the img element, using the values from the range inputs.

JavaScript Modifications: The JavaScript was modified to handle the new box-shadow controls. 

Enhanced CSS Code Display: The CSS code display area now shows all CSS variable values, allowing users to see the updated CSS code reflecting their changes.

These changes enable users to dynamically adjust the box-shadow effect on the image using range sliders and view the corresponding CSS code in real-time.
