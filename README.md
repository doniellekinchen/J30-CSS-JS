<h1>Javascript30- Day 3</h1>
<h3>Along with the starter code, I added more functions to make it more user friendly:</h3>

Added Box-Shadow Controls: Four new range inputs were added to control the box-shadow properties - horizontal shadow, vertical shadow, blur radius, and spread radius.

Updated CSS: CSS was updated to apply the box-shadow property directly to the img element, using the values from the range inputs.

JavaScript Modifications: The JavaScript was modified to handle the new box-shadow controls. Event listeners were added to these controls to update the CSS code and the image in real-time as the user adjusts the sliders.

Enhanced CSS Code Display: The CSS code display area now shows all CSS variable values, including the new box-shadow properties, allowing users to see the updated CSS code reflecting their changes.

Improved Readability: Comments were added to the code for better understanding, and the code structure was improved for clarity.

These changes enable users to dynamically adjust the box-shadow effect on the image using range sliders and view the corresponding CSS code in real-time.
